# What is this repository used for?

Basically, I use it for my personal use. It allows me to switch fast between my two main speakers (headphones and speakers).


## Usage

Of course, you can use this for your personal use. Just clone the repository, edit the desired devices' name in the list_speakers() method, and run the script with python command line or with the .bat file.
